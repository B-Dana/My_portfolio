        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>My name is Dana Badmaeva. I'm originally from Kazakhstan, but live in Hillsboro, Oregon for 7 years now. I have a Bachelor and Master degree in Economics. I worked in Kazakhstan at Mitsubishi elevators installation company as a Field Operation Department Coordinator for 2,5 years. In 2010 I entered USC for my Master's program. After graduating I got married and now have two beautiful daughters: <em>Adelia and Elza</em>. I've always been an A student and love to challenge myself with learning something new. This is the main reason I came to <span class="special">Epicodus</span>. Ater 6 years of being a full-time mom I decided to try something new, and if I like it, probably, change careers.  </p>
